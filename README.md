# PAMOxide

> Work in progress!

A readable and simple reimplementation of Linux-PAM in Rust.

## Goal

This project has two aims. The first and primary aim is to implement the PAM API in Rust. The second and more experimental goal is to replace the `libpam.so` in most Linux distributions with this implementation. It would also be nice to make PAM more debuggable.
